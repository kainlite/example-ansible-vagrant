### Example config of mail, web, db with ansible on a vagrant vm
All configs in vars.yml should be replaced since they are not secure and are here only to provide an example of how to set them up but in a really basic fashion, it could be enhanced with multiple security features, but that is an excercise for the future.

##### Run
```
vagrant up
```

##### Teardown and destroy
```
vagrant destroy
```
